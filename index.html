          <p>
            Hello! My name is Joy-Deborah Banadda. Im in 10th grade and I love listening to music, watching shows on netflix or peacock,
            and doing my homework. Im currently focusing on keeping my grades up and obtaining the best possible scores I can for my future, 
            becuase I would like to become a Paediatric Neurosurgeon!

            I wa sborn in teh USA, but for mostly of my life I lived in Africa, I'm not fully used tobeing here and I do miss the my 
            friends and family I left behind. Anyways I hope you enjoy my project!

        <h2>My Choose-Your-Own Adventure Project</h2>
        <p>This is my Choose Your Own Adventrue project! WE had to basically create a story that had different choices for you to pick from
          and we used links (to link the different pages of the story becuase they wre on different html pages), font, and images to make it look pretty scary. 
          I hope you like our theme.
